MeZIGO provides a platform that powers online merchants deliveries. We partner with brick and mortar stores to enable fast, cheap and convenient deliveries to collection points across Nairobi, Kenya. The cost of deliveries incurred by online merchants in Nairobi to deliver to the customer's home often gets higher than the purchase price of the item. This makes many merchants avoid same day delivery and instead bulk deliveries.
