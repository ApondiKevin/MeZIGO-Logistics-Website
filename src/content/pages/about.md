At MeZIGO, we provide a platform that powers online merchants to deliver fast, cheaply and conveniently. We pride ourselves for delivering happiness to customers. MeZIGO was started to play a part in solving the need of online merchants to deliver to customers cheaply. i.e. a Ksh250 products are mostly delivered at Ksh200.  We started off at Rahimtula Trust Building along Moi Avenue with a team of two and friends who were happy to help.

Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. Well, then good news! It's a suppository. Then we'll go with that data file! **I've been there.** *My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants.* What am I, the pope?

Daddy Bender, we're hungry. We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral! We're rescuing ya. We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home.

I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! I never loved you. OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun!

1. And from now on you're all named Bender Jr.
2. Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head."
3. You wouldn't. Ask anyway!

Bender, quit destroying the universe! No! The cat shelter's on to me. Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. Fatal. I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself.

I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money. You mean while I'm sleeping in it? I don't want to be rescued.

* You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go.
* And when we woke up, we had these bodies.
* Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun!

Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.

You mean while I'm sleeping in it? I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared… Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. Negative, bossy meat creature!

Oh God, what have I done? I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want! Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually! Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase.
